          Across all of these social media platforms, the pattern is the
          same.They watch us closely, learn what we want, and gently push us
          toward what they want us to see. What started as places to connect
          with friends slowly turned into quiet laboratories studying our
          behavior. Every click we make, every post we linger on, every tiny
          pause in our scrolling becomes a signal, another clue about who we are
          and what might sway us. Bit by bit, our online lives are turned into
          data, and that data is used not just to sell us things, but to shape
          our choices, our moods, and sometimes even our beliefs. It’s subtle,
          almost invisible a times, but it’s always there learning from us in
          ways we rarely notice.
