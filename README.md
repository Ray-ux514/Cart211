Feeds is an interactive digital experience that exposes the invisible systems shaping the content we consume online. Every page mimics a piece of the algorithmic journey searching, scrolling, being distracted, being warned, and ultimately choosing whether to break free from the feed. The project demonstrates how social platforms track behavior, predict preferences, and guide attention, often without users noticing. By blending simulation, distortion, and subtle interruptions, Feeds reveals how surveillance driven algorithms shape what we see, how long we look, and what we believe. The site invites users to question the illusion of control and reflect on how “free” their online experience really is.
